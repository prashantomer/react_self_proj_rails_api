# Compartir Espacios API

This project is only the JSON based API of the compartir espacios app. The app itself is
made up of this API server and a standalone frontend client (single page application)

It's implemented as a stateless server, and we use [JWT](https://jwt.io) for authentication.
We're not versioning this API, so every client will need to be kept up to date. At the moment we're
only contemplating one: the web client. There's a possibility of a ReactNative client in the
future.

## Requirements

You will need a recent ruby version, `2.3.1` is what I'm using.


### How do I set this up?

Clone the repository in your local machine:

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:compartirespacios/compartir_espacios_api.git
```

Run `bundle install` to install all the gems we are using.
